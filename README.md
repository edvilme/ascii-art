# ascii-art

Made this for my GF but thought it was cool enough to make it public. Fills image with user-defined text. Built with C++ and WebAssembly

Huge props to [nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for implementation of image handling. 

Support for adjusting contrast levels, Gaussian blur, etc.
